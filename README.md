# Face Recognition using Python and Pillow

## Installation
  * [Install dlib](https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/629d75c1baac34dfa5ca2a1928a7aeaf)
  * [Install Face_recognition library using PIP](https://pypi.org/project/face_recognition/)
  
## Prerequisites
  * A collection of pictures on which you'll train your model (i.e database of known persons).
  * A Octa-core CPU, because if you are trying to train lots of pictures, It's gonna cost you more time. So more the merrier.
  * The picture of who we are trying to identify (duh).

### Basically next steps are self explanatory if you have minimum python experience.

# Example

## Input 
![alt text](./unknown/group.jpg)

## Output

![alt text](./identified.jpg)


#### P.S: That's how I named them. :D


## Input 
![alt text](./unknown/s8.jpg)

## Output
![alt text](./identifieds8.jpg)

#### If you zoom and see, Theon Greyjoy and Euron Greyrjoy will be identified as Euron. This is because those both actors shares some resemblance. 

### The Accuracy of this model is 95%.
